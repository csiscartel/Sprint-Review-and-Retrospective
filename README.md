**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

**1. How can I understand user requirements and translate them into a program? So how does developing “user stories” assist with that?**

Understanding what your users want How do you even get started to "understand" what your users want? That means striving to know not just what the users request, but what they need sometimes detecting latent problems they might not even know they have. Guiding methods like user interviews, surveys and direct observations based on gather insights. Once these needs are identified, they are translated into programming features and requirements.

User stories are great Agile tools to capture user’s wants and needs in a simple, structured way. The format for any user story is: “As a [role], I want [goal/desire] so that [why]” It allows the team to think from user’s viewpoint, prioritize tasks and truth fact that whether feature is benefiting a user or not. User stories also promote collaboration and simplicity, which in turn, makes it easier to split up large requirements into smaller tasks.

**2. How do I write programs? What would I like to take with me from Agile methods for my own further work?**

I design my programs iteratively and with the user in mind. I begin by identifying the requirements, taking them apart into small tasks I know are accomplishable, and then build a little, test it out a little, and refine it a little. This can facilitate early feedback and continuous improvement, mitigating the potential for large problems appearing late in the development stage.

The sorts of agile practices I’ll be watching for in the future:

Sprints and Iterations: Iterating over work in short time frames to produce value and changing as necessary.

Daily Stand-ups: Keeping the team in sync and clearing blockers as quickly as possible.

Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives: Reflecting and constantly advancing team interactions.

They are the practices that make it possible to build flexible, quality software that fits and works for it's users.

**3. What is being a good team member in software?**

Good team members do more than just writing code — they contribute, communicate, and stay accountable. A good team member is an active listener, shared knower and supporter. They are dependable, they do what they say they are going to do, and they are open about what works and what does not.

Engaged members are full participants in Agile ceremonies, provide feedback that makes a difference, and are committed to learning non-stop. They value other opinions and are responsive to change, working to deliver value to users. In the end, a good team member helps create an environment in which everyone can succeed.
